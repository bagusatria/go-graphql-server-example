# go-graphql-server-example

I've created an example of a GraphQL server using go-graphql. I hope it can be useful to someone who is learning GraphQL with Go. This example was tested using Go v1.12.

## Run the example
```
cd cd src/cmd/server/
go run main.go
```

## Acess graphiQL after running the example

http://localhost:3000/graphiql
